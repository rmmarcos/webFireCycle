The general objective of the FLARE project is to anticipate the potential increase in catastrophic wildfires and develop a science-based national strategy for risk mitigation and adaptation in Spain. To achieve this goal, we aim to identify high-priority management areas, with a particular focus on densely populated, fire-prone locations that are likely to experience a significant rise in extreme fires due to changing climate. This information is critical for the development of short-term accelerated management strategies aimed at addressing the ongoing wildfire crisis.
